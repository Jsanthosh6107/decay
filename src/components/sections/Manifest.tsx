          <h3>The start of the end</h3>
          <p>Everything fails together. This isn't just a single failure, but multiple scattered that cumulatively lead to collapse.Like a city starved of resources, the body shuts down as critical functions don't replenish.</p>

          <h2>Hematopoietic</h2>
          <h3>Stem Cell Failure</h3>
          <p>White blood cells drop to almost 0. There's no immune system left. No blood clotting. This isn't a case of low counts. This is a loss of manufacturing capability, and there's nothing the body can do.</p>

          <h2>Gastrointestinal</h2>
          <h3>Barrier loss</h3>
          <p>The intestinal lining often replenishes every few days. This time, it sheds and doesn't return. Severe diarrhea, massive fluid loss, and no intestinal barrier enables gut bacteria to travel freely. blood loss is self sustained. the GI system collapses. </p>

          <h2>Cutaneous</h2>
          <h3>Skin loss</h3>
          <p>Skin falls off like leaves from a tree with the basal layer stem cells destroyed. fluids and heat leak out like a leaking faucet, costing further nutrients from an imploding body. the bodies strongest defense sloughs off like an animal shedding.</p>

          <h2>Respiratory</h2>
          <h3>Oxygen depletion</h3>
          <p>With lung tissue affected, oxygen demands increase with capability decreased. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary, but intervention is equally difficult by bleeding risk.</p>

          <h2>Muscle breakdown</h2>
          <h3>fall to collapse</h3>
          <p>with necrotic tissue releasing myoglobin into circulation, the kidneys are overwhelmed, leading to kidney and renal failure. amputation may be considered, but even that is restricted by bleeding risk and failure to heal.</p>
