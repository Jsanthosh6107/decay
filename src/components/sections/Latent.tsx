          <p>your body seems to recover. even if no new cells are being produced, mature cells are still alive, functioning... for now. Your brain calms down. From it's perspective, it's like nothing happened.</p>

          <h3>Depleting supplies without renewal</h3>
          <p>Platelets can survive for days. The intestinal lining may appear intact. Nothing has failed yet, because nothing has run out. The body continues operating, using the last functioning cells it produced before exposure.</p>
