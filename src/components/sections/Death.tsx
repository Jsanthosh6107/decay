          <h2>Terminal Phase</h2>
          <h3>Support Replaces Function</h3>
          <p>At high doses, the manifest phase does not stabilize. machines replace circulation, respiration, renal... and autonomous function continues to decline.</p>

          <h2>Shock Physiology</h2>
          <h3>Circulatory Instability</h3>
          <p>Vascular tone collapses. Fluids from the bloodstream shift into tissue, the GI tract, compromised skin systems, further destabilizing blood pressure, with constant blood transfusion necessary for life. Sepsis devastates the body anyway, further stressing stressed systems.</p>

          <h2>Cardiac Arrest</h2>
          <h3>Neurological Decline</h3>
          <p>Repeated cardiac arrest begins to follow loss of reserves. return of circulation does not indicate restoration of function.</p>

          <h2>Renal and Hepatic Failure</h2>
          <h3>Metabolic collapse</h3>
          <p>Kidney and liver failure follows prolonged hypotension, circulating toxins, myoglobin load, and systemic inflammation. dialysis is necessary.</p>

          <h2>Secondary Infections</h2>
          <h3>No walls left</h3>
          <p>With no separation and defense of the external and internal, bacteria, fungal, and viral pathogens freely enter the body with nothing to stop or attack them.</p>

          <h2>The End</h2>
          <p>With a body maintained by artificial machines, conditions continuing to decline, and the body all but destroyed, cardiac arrest is often allowed to end life.</p>
