          <h2>Prodrome Phase</h2>
          <h3>Delayed Reaction</h3>
          <p>Minutes to hours after exposure, your body begins to respond. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue. the face may be flushed. the eyes bloodshot. the interval between exposure and first symptoms, is the only visible window to your fate.</p>

          <h2>The Vomiting</h2>
          <h3>Chemical Alarms</h3>
          <p>Radiation exposure causes widespread cellular injury within minutes. tissue releases imflammation signals to the brain, signaling poison in the body. Your brain assumes you're being poisoned, and reflexively tries to protect you. You're not being poisoned.</p>

          <h2>The headaches</h2>
          <h3>Inflammatory response</h3>
          <p>Radiation triggers cytokines, vascular changes, fluid changes, increasing pressure in tissues. It feels like you sustained impact or trauma. You did not. </p>

          <h2>Misfiring</h2>
          <h3>No proper response</h3>
          <p>Radiation sickness isn't accounted for like viruses or bacteria. Your brain feels widespread cellular damage, it responds correctly, but there's no poison to flush out, no physical injury to respond to. It responds to a signal, but it's response won't solve anything</p>
